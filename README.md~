# LowPolyHack

Steps to get Low Poly style

- Reduce noise:
    Why: Noise will affect edge detection. 
    Averaging: Good for removing grain noise (bad)
    Gaussian filters
- Edge detection
    Why: 
    Because Delaunay Triangulation genrates vertices randomly. Need to add edge constraints.
- Delaunay triangulation
- Colorize
